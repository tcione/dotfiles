# tcione's dotfiles

Hey, welcome :)

These are my personal dotfiles, feel free to get things from here and apply to your own stuff. A few word of info before we move on:

- This started out as a fork of [Mathias's dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). A few things are still from there, but most of the things were replaced
- I've recently migrated to [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). This helps out with managing and installing the configs. I'm quite happy

## Setup
`./install` . To get what will be executed, please look at `install.conf.yaml`
